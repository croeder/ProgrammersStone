<a href="http://www.aitriz.org/">TRIZ</a> A remarkable Russian website
describing an approach that complements the Stone. One point - while the
objective laws governing the development of technical systems are quite real,
the resultant algorithm is <i>not</i> proceduralisable in a programmatic sense.
The use of the word "imaginative" at each point in the description of the
algorithm recognises this. TRIZ could be used to semi-proceduralise the ideas
in the Stone for introduction to the workplace, and the Stone explores the
necessary psychological development of the TRIZ user.

<h3>Adams, Scott</h3>
<h3>The Dilbert Future</h3>
Boxtree<br>
ISBN 0-7522-1118-8<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Very funny and perceptive. A lot of nonsense is talked about Adams. Some
say that he has failed to champion the cause of cubicle dwellers. As far as
I know, he has never claimed to be the cubicle dwellers' champion - just a
very funny cartoonist. Others say that he is a terrible, cynical person.
This is because he documents workplace stupidity with staggering accuracy.
All of the pomposity, dishonesty, bullying and ritualism is there. The
end section of this book, about affirmations etc.  should make your hair
stand on end.
</p>

<h3>Brookes, Frederick P.</h3>
<h3>The Mythical Man-Month</h3>
Addison Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-00650-2<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Generally recognised as the most sensible guide to running practical,
effective software projects, Brookes' every observation seems to have been
thrown out by the ISO9001 ritual fixing zombies. This is why commercial
software production is stagnant.
</p>

<h3>DeMarco, Tom &amp; Lister, Timothy</h3>
<h3>Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h3>
Dorset House<br>
ISBN 0-932633-05-6<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Common sense observations regarding making effective software projects.
The best bits are the railing against open-plan offices. In Reciprocality,
open-plan can be seen as desirable because ritual fixers love to regard
one anothers' ritualised movements all day, and the endlessly ringing
phones don't cause a problem, because no-one thinks anyway. Also look out
for the comments on "jelled teams" and "professionalism" which is exposed as
a euphemism for smirking  pomposity.
</p>

<h3>Degrace, Peter &amp; Stahl, Leslie Hulet</h3>
<h3>The Olduvai Imperative</h3>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13-220104-6<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
The authors set out to write a book about CASE tools, and discovered the
vast spaces waiting to be explored when we ask what we are really doing when
we make software. I don't think the "Greeks vs. Romans" split they propose 
works too well, but they do introduce the idea that there are two distinct
approaches.
</p>

<h3>Feynman, Richard P.</h3>
<h3>Feynman Lectures on Computation</h3>
Addison Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-20148991-0<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
All good, but particularly the sections on Charles Bennett and the energy
value of information. This book was stuck in legal wrangles for 10 years,
but now we can get Feynman's words on this remarkable result, so essential
in Reciprocality.

<h3>Gamma, Erich et. al.</h3>
<h3>Design Patterns: Elements of reusable Object-Oriented Software</h3>
Addison Wesley<br>
ISBN 0-201-63361-2<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<i>The</i> book on design patterns. Emphasises the compositional aspects
of software design - the bit M0 victims can't do. Very handy on sites
where the M0 reductionist misinterpretation of ISO9001 has got entirely out of
hand. You just reference the pattern (by name) in the Architectural Design
Document, and talk about details in the Detailed Design Document. This
produces a useful document that doesn't <i>prevent</i> good composition by
requiring the design to fit into an imbecilic, mandatory document structure
created by people who can't understand what composition is, but are
determined to stop it!

<h3>The Goal</h3>
Gow<br>
ISBN 0-566-07418-4<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Fairy stories about how our heros manage to think around M0 and
solve problems, instead of being driven off site with their stuff in
binliners, which is what would really happen.

<h3>Goldratt, Eliyahu M.</h3>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
As far as anyone could go towards the Programmers' Stone while retaining
M0 paradigm and language. The closest thing to the Programmers' Stone in
print. The Journey of the title is of course, Hermetic.

<h3>Levy, Steven</h3>
<h3>Hackers</h3>
Penguin<br>
ISBN 0-14-023269-9<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
How the "clearly very stupid" people changed the world. Starring Anukin
Gates as the young Darth Vader. (Fact: In 1978 I bought a Microsoft
product called EDAS for TRS-80 Model I. It was such rubbish I used it to write
it's replacement and threw it away. The musicassette tape it came on was too
small to hold anything useful. It's lineal descendent is called MASM.)

<h3>Naur, Peter</h3>
<h3>Computing: A Human Activity</h3>
ACM Press<br>
ISBN 0-201-58069-1<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Wise words from the dawn of time. How could it possibly be anything
<i>other</i> than a human activity, but people have forgotten this.
</p>

<h3>Schwartz, Howard S.</h3>
<h3>Narcissistic Process and Corporate Decay</h3>
New York University Press<br>
ISBN 0-8147-7938-7 <br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
Describes M0 in commercial settings in a Freudian model. The model is
largely correct of course - M0 rather than infantile memories is where the
motivational and delusional structure comes from.

<h3>Senge, Peter M.</h3>
<h3>The Fifth Discipline</h3>
Random House<br>
ISBN 0-7126-5687-1<br>

M0 free business thinking. Introduces "Sengian Patterns", which I reckon
M0 victims will not be able to spot in real world situations.

<h3>Spencer-Brown, George</h3>

<h3>Weinberg, Gerald M.</h3>
<h3>The Psychology of Computer Programming</h3>
Van Nostrand Reinhold<br>
ISBN 0-442-20764-6<br>

</p>

<h3>White, Michael</h3>
<h3>Isaac Newton - The Last Sorcerer</h3>
Fourth Estate<br>
ISBN 1-85702-416-8<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
White doesn't seem to understand that alchemy is a transformation of the
operator - mapping - but his journalism is excellent so you can draw your
own conclusions from his data.
</p>

<h3>Yourdon, Edward</h3>
<h3>Decline and Fall of the American Programmer</h3>
Prentice Hall<br>
ISBN 0-13203670-3<br>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
I've not yet seen the second edition. The offshore problem didn't happen,
because programming isn't the kind of context-free proceduralism people
think can be done well in open plan offices. Sets out the dreary predictability
of the standard management stupidity rituals in M0 shops.
